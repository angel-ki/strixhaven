Elric (he/him) is an upbeat, confident Bard guy (big himbo energy) who is next in line to inherit the business once the parents are ready to pass it down in the family (which Lennian is in full support of), and he takes this future for himself very seriously. Elric is interested in the Quandrix college, as he wants to improve his knowledge of numbers, leadership, and how to analyze statistical data to be able run the business effectively as the future CEO (or dnd equivalent of that lol). He and Lennian are extremely good friends and have always had each other's backs in any scenario they have faced together. He is bombastic, determined, outgoing and charming, but also can be a little overzealous at times, but he always has the best intentions in mind. He is dedicated to his studies, but also is very much looking forward to the “traditional college experience,” which might lead to some all-nighters every once in a while.
