 Reyna (she/they) is a more reserved, poised Wizard who has their own interests that don’t necessarily align directly with the family business. They are a very talented writer who is striving to be a novelist and journalist, which has led them to take interest in the Silverquill college to sharpen her literary skills. She and Lennian are extremely close. She has always been the voice of reason for her, and is someone who Lennian knows she can always go to if she needs some advice, help on an assignment, or just someone to listen. She is intelligent, self-assured, easy-going and tranquill, though it is not very easy to tell what she is thinking at times. They are the kind of person that does not need to study too much in order to absorb the information, but she does it anyway because she will guilt trip herself for ‘wasting time.’ She would much rather spend a night in rather than going out, but when she does, she can be found in the library, helping manage the Strixhaven Star newspaper, or wandering the outside gardens looking for a relaxing place for some peaceful nature ambiance.
