[Sholeh](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#sholeh_jttrc) is a legendary figure in the history of the Citadel. Having led the successful effort to rediscover the Radiant Citadel, she was the first Speaker for the Ancestors and is the only originator of that position to still hold the office. This is, at least in part, because she is a famed [ancient brass dragon](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#ancient%20brass%20dragon_mm) of Akharin Sangar. Unlike many of her kind, she is neutral good and a pragmatic, shrewd leader. For two hundred and fifty years, she has been a consummate councilor and has deftly managed the complex politics of the city. She hopes to find the missing twelve founding civilizations and believes the fate of the Citadel depends on it.

Known affectionately (or derisively) as the Old Lady, she often takes the form of an older, brown-skinned human woman. Quick to anger and quicker to love, she has rivals and adversaries aplenty, but friends and suitors in even greater number. She loves a good drink, loves dancing even more, and spends her free time with the common citizens of the city. More frequently, she's legislating in the council or negotiating in a secret corner of the Court of Whispers, trading for information or sending spies on missions.

She has a complex relationship with her homeland. While she loves Akharin Sangar, she refuses to bend to the will of its angelic ruler, [Atash](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#atash_jttrc). Rather than oppose him directly, she plays a delicate political game even as she worries about the future of her native land.

In recent years, the weight of leadership has taken a toll on [Sholeh](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#sholeh_jttrc). She picks her scales in private as she tries to find relief.
