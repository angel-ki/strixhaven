## Regarding the Book
To work at the Biblioplex, Cosimo must pass a test from The Librarian. Cosimo must find a lost book that has been missing since last year in the possession of one second year student, Emban Sharoth. It's titled *Advanced Augmentation for Students* and was written by Dean Kianne and Saphyra Yarann. Emban Sharoth is involved in the Dragonchess Club and can be found playing with other students at the weekly tournament. His unique look has made him incredibly recognizable to other Quandrix students. Emban knows exactly where the book is as he had checked it out as a first year to prevent others from reading his mother's research. He augmented it into a charm that he now wears as a necklace. The color of the cover was also augmented to black in order to match his aesthetic. If Cosimo explains the situation, Emban is willing to make a deal with him. He'll return it as long as Cosimo promises to hide it once he starts working as a shelver.

## Simplified Dragonchess
Emban points to a board on the table and takes a seat. He smirks, "I'll make a deal with you. Let's play a game of Dragonchess. I win and you walk away. I lose and I'll give you the book if you promise to hide it while shelving. I'll even give you an advantage."
- Kobold and Dragon pieces
- Kobolds have 1 HP and deal 1 damage; Dragons have 3 HP and deal 3 damage; Kobolds can move one square and Dragons can move 3 squares per turn. To land on a square, you must kill the enemy piece.
- Emban plays as the Kobolds. There are two rows.  
- Players are the Dragons. Each player gets a dragon piece. It magically changes to their aesthetic when they grab it. Even stranger, they feel like they are standing on the chess board themselves.
- The Kobold player takes a turn after every two dragons and the Dragon players can each make one move per turn. When there is one Kobold piece left, Kobold player can call upon a founder dragon as a last ditch effort.

Going to the Night Market


At the very end of the session, players overhear the following:
> *Shouting rises over the sounds of haggling shoppers and the sizzle of cooking street food. A shrill voice cries out, "Give it back, you little thief!"*
> *"No, you're the thief!" replies a youngster with a panicked squeak. An instant later, a frantic kobold bursts from the crowd clutching a sizable bunch of green onions. A flustered gnome woman chases him.*
