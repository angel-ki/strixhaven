In last session:
- Players attended orientation and completed the scavenger hunt
- Morgan joined the Distinguished Society of Fine Arts, Cosimo and Avery joined the Dragonsguard Historical Society, and Lennian joined the Fantastical Horticultural Club
- After defeating a mimic table, players are thanked by Professor Sharpbeak and each are given a platinum coin.
- They leave the Biblioplex and see a small group of three students wearing navy blue robes rushing through the park with supplies overflowing in their arms. A paper is dropped and the players are invited to a secretive party led by a group named, the Hooker Society


1. Possibly find a food source for Gust
2. Attend the Hooker Society party and have fun!

> *As you follow the three hooded figures through the Commons, they step off the beaten path and stride confidently past a sign that reads "No entry beyond this point." Others don't seem to notice, too lost in their time with friends or work to pay attention. You can distantly hear sounds of rippling water. Perhaps, there's a waterfall not too far off.* 

To find a food source players can:
- search for Professor Crow and ask for her assistance
- Wander to Witherbloom (players would then run into Indica who would then take them to Professor Valentin)

With a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a player can tell that there is some kind of magic surrounding the sign and this path. 

When they arrive at the sanctuary, Aurora Luna Wynterstarr, Azure Caiveer, Mina Lee pull down their navy hoods. They talk about the hooker society and their goals for the creatures in their care. 
- Azure had been working on an assignment to created an enchanted art piece. Her plans were to create a felted set of wings that gives the user a fly speed using a lightweight, waterproof yarn made from reeds. One thing led to another and many hours (much to Mina's displeasure) were spent in the bog collecting materials. Eventually, she noticed that the Jewelfish were dying off unexpectedly quickly and she needed their scales to dye her piece. She told a friend from Witherbloom about her concerns and the two worked together to save the fish, transporting them to a hidden location after a professor's suggestion. Azure never finished the wings last year but has continued to work on them even as problems continue to crop up. 
	- Fish have started to disappear?
	- Future dreams of a fundraiser to help the creatures in the bog? 

Indica Greene is also present for the party, but shows up late with a new drink, Sonata. Sonata is a pale pink drink that shimmers with glittering magic. If observed with a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a player senses that it is fey in nature. Those who fail a DC 10 CON Save may find themselves randomly bursting into song for the following hour.
- **Sonata Wine:** A cultivar of grape in the vineyards originating from eladrin nobility. Vintners throughout the Feywild considered it a mediocre grape until Hebaru Tonaro discovered the grape’s secret quality: It loves song. If the vine is cared for with melodious song throughout its life, it develops into a unique fruit from which expert winemakers of the eladrin nobility can make an exceptional wine.
- The amount of work that goes into singing a grape to greatness makes bottles of sonata wine rare. What’s more, the quality of song dictates the quality of the resulting grape, and the finest singers prefer to perform for crowds of appreciative people rather than for silent, impassive fruit. Still, many singers have earned small fortunes by dedicating themselves to the vine for a season.

| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dragon | A dragon is the **best hand** in the game. It means you roll one of every value (1,2,3,4). If two or more players roll a dragon, they roll again to break the tie.                           |
| A+     | An A+ is the **second-best hand.** It's comprised of a roll of four and three other non-identical numbers. If two players roll an A+, the one with the higher combined numerical value wins. |
| Mascot | A mascot is a roll with four of the same number except one (2,2,2,2/3,3,3,3/4,4,4,4). It's the **third-best** hand.                                                                          |
| Snarl  | A snarl is a roll of four ones (1,1,1,1). It's the **lowest hand** in the game and requires an ante to the pot.                                                                              |
