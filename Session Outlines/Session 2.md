In last session:
- Players attended orientation and completed the scavenger hunt
- Morgan joined the Distinguished Society of Fine Arts, Cosimo and Avery joined the Dragonsguard Historical Society, and Lennian joined the Fantastical Horticultural Club
- After defeating a mimic table, players are thanked by Professor Sharpbeak and each are given a platinum coin.
- They leave the Biblioplex and see a small group of three students wearing navy blue robes rushing through the park with supplies overflowing in their arms. A paper is dropped and the players are invited to a secretive party led by a group named, the Hooker Society


1. Possibly find a food source for Gust
2. Attend the Hooker Society party

> *As you follow the three hooded figures through the Commons, they step off the beaten path and stride confidently past a sign that reads "No entry beyond this point." Beyond it, you can hear sounds of rippling water. Perhaps, there's a waterfall not too far off.*
