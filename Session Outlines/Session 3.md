*Most of you wake up for the day with a pounding headache and a growling stomach to an announcement sounding out from your Strixhaven Ring. Attention students, this Friday is the last day to apply for a work study experience. If interested, find your advisor for more information today.

If Avery does not wake up on time, he wakes up to one or both of his parents banging on the door of his dorm room. They think he didn't show up to his appointment because he's upset about what happened with Erasmus.

To work at the Biblioplex, Cosimo must pass a test from The Librarian. Cosimo must find a lost book that has been missing since last year in the possession of one second year student, Emban Sharoth. It's titled *Advanced Augmentation for Students* and was written by Dean Kianne and Saphyra Yarann. Emban Sharoth is involved in the Dragonchess Club and can be found playing with other students at the weekly tournament. His unique look has made him incredibly recognizable to other Quandrix students. Emban knows exactly where the book is as he had checked it out as a first year to prevent others from reading his mother's research. He augmented it into a charm that he now wears as a necklace. The color of the cover was also augmented to black in order to match his aesthetic. If Cosimo explains the situation, Emban is willing to make a deal with him. He'll return it as long as Cosimo promises to hide it once he starts working as a shelver.

At the very end of the session, players overhear the following:
> *Shouting rises over the sounds of haggling shoppers and the sizzle of cooking street food. A shrill voice cries out, "Give it back, you little thief!"*
> *"No, you're the thief!" replies a youngster with a panicked squeak. An instant later, a frantic kobold bursts from the crowd clutching a sizable bunch of green onions. A flustered gnome woman chases him.*
