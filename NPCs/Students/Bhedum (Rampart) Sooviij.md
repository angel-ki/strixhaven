- Extracurriculars: Dragonchess Club, Dragonsguard Historical Society

- Bond Boon: Rampart's commanding presence rubs off, and when you're trying to avoid campus security, your fellow students always help you lie low.
- Bond Bane: Library books you need inexplicably go missing at key times, especially those about history. As a result, you can't pull all-nighters.
