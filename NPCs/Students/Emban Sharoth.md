**Description**
Emban sticks out like a sore thumb at Quandrix, but other students there have learnt not to misjudge his tough and edgy appearance. Emban was an only child to two failed academics living in Radiance, who always encouraged him to aim for Strixhaven, and to become a Augmenter. The pressure from his parents caused him to act out as a teenager, but now that he is an adult, he has grown out of that. He still has a bit of a temper, and likes to express his edgy side through his appearance, but he is a hard studier and has a natural gift for augmentation. 

**Bond Boon:** Emban is willing to help you out with his augmentation magic, if you ask nicely.
