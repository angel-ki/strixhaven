Murgaxor is currently masquerading as Zor Bazhio, a second year student (this body originally belonged to one of his victims and was his first successful attempt at necromancy with the eldritch balm).
He technically works with the Oriq but they're both using each other. The Oriq wants his alchemy for bringing back the Dracolich and he wants their protection before he can become a lich and leave them behind.
