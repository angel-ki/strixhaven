1. Interests: historical artifacts and artifact recreation
2. Well known to academia as a master of his craft, he is also well known among his local peers as "The Childish Professor". While his perpetual enthusiasm is on first meeting intoxicating, his often meandering trains of thought, unrestrained manners and know-it-all arrogance can become tiresome if no-one is there to keep him in check. While many can criticize his person, nobody can deny that it is his odd imagination that has allowed him to make many advances in the field of magical items. Most of his students just study from the textbook.
3. Consumed by his work and so oblivious he has no idea that he is involved with the Oriq.
