1. Interests: sedgemoor alchemy
2. They just walked out of the bog one day and became a professor. Very few know the story of how exactly that happened. They are incredibly passionate about helping their students even if it involves breaking a few rules (being a bog creature unfamiliar with society has got to come in handy somehow). They know nothing of their past before walking out of the bog and are searching for the truth. Itâ€™s connected to the Oriq (corrupted wild magic?).
